# Academic_Projects
 Some of the various Academic Projects completed by Micah Rose-Mighty during the pursuit of my Bachelor of Science with Major Computer Science at Brock University (2018 - 2023)

Due to the fact that this is a repository of some of my various Academic Projects completed during my time at university, my work may be unconventional, unorthodox, buggy, or simply incorrect.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a useful reminder for how far I've come in my journey as a developer, since my first "Hello World" Program I wrote in high school when I knew nothing of the subject to my final project completed during the pursuit of my degree. It may be painful looking back at some of my old work, but that's my intention to display some of my portfolio and my progress as a developer. I was told that if there's ever a time when I don't potential changes or improvements that could be made to my old code, then I've stopped improving. Here's to life-long learning. Enjoy!
